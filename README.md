## Dice Wars

The goal of this project is to create a game that is a sort of amalgam of
Risk, Cattan, and the Flash game Dice Wars. Tiles will randomly generate
particular resources that can be used to buy long term benefits in the form of
offensive/defensive structures or short term benefits in the form of arial
attacks or extra troops.

### Potential ideas

* Resource sabotage (e.g. salted earth retreat makes wheat square useless until
  recuperation efforts are made)
